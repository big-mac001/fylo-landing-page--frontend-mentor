## My Process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Fylo's landing page was my first attempt at developing a project all by myself and I'm glad to have learned more about responsive design. It was also intriguing to learn about CSS properties like the background-repeat, background-size, and background-position.

### Continued development

I will continue to focus on building projects with all I have learned and also improve my knowledge of responsive design.
